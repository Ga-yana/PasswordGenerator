## This is a React project. 

Have used react hooks: useRef, useCallback and useEffect.

useEffect hook is used to handle data fetches and DOM manipulation. Here whenever the user clicks or changes certain options , the useEffect hook is triggered and a new password is generated. 

useCallBack Hook returns memoized callback function, it helps in optimization process.

useRef is used when we want a reference of a variable.
